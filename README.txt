Welcome to CatHolic üê±

Thank you for downloading CatHolic!

This app shows an animated cat in your macOS menu bar that moves faster when your CPU is busier. It's a fun way to keep an eye on your system's performance.

Installation:
1. Drag "CatHolic.app" into your "Applications" folder.
2. Open it from the Applications folder.
3. If you see a warning that the app is from an unidentified developer:
   - Right-click (or Control-click) on "CatHolic.app" and select "Open"
   - Click "Open" again in the dialog that appears
   - This only needs to be done the first time

Uninstallation:
- Simply delete "CatHolic.app" from your Applications folder.

Note:
This app is not distributed through the Mac App Store and has not been notarized by Apple. This is why macOS may show a warning the first time you try to run it.

Enjoy your CPU-cat companion!
